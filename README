REQUIRES WAX BACKGROUND CURL

SETUP:

* Move the included vimeo.tmp file to your public directory and rename to vimeo.php
* Create an application on the account (with write access)
  * Set the application address to be local versions (http://site.dev/vimeo.php etc)
  * Swap out 'CONSUMER KEY' & 'CONSUMER SECRET' with app keys and config/vimeo/consumer/key + config/vimeo/consumer/secret
* In the browser, go to http://site.dev/vimeo.php
* Click the authorise link
* Approve the app
* The page you are returned to will contain a list of the videos uploaded to the account
  and at the bottom a print_r of $_SESSION
* oauth_access_token is config/vimeo/oauth/key
* oauth_access_token_secret is config/vimeo/oauth/secret

Now try running a simple controller action to fetch videos from the account
